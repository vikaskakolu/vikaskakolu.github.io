      <title>Virtual CFO for Startups</title>

      <description>We understand that the founders do not enjoy even a moment being deviated from bringing the next cutting-edge product/service. Time is everything for the start-up and the best way to make more of it is through outsourcing the entire finance compliance function to a CFO who does not come at a cost of hiring an individual CFO for the start-up. Instead of having an internal finance setup for the start-up and burning energy and other resources of the business, it is smart to outsource the function to Finwhizz.</description>
