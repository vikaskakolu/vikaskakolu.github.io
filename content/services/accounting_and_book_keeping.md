Accounting & Book-keeping is probably the most traditional yet, the most essential for all sorts of organisations. Partnering with Finwhizz enables our clients to enjoy an end-to-end accounting service which is fully system integrated and as simple as sending an image over a whatsapp. This is to ensure that our clients focus entirely on what they do best and we take on the entire load of accounting function. 
We encourage regular accounting and whether our clients prefer a real-time book-keeping or weekly or monthly service model, we deliver. Even when we hear that there is a pending annual accounting to be done, we ensure our clientsâ€™ requests are fulfilled.
