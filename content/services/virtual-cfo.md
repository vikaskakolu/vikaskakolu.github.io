We understand that the founders do not enjoy even a moment being deviated from bringing the next cutting-edge product/service. Time is everything for the start-up and the best way to make more of it is through outsourcing the entire finance compliance function to a CFO who does not come at a cost of hiring an individual CFO for the start-up. Instead of having an internal finance setup for the start-up and burning energy and other resources of the business, it is smart to outsource the function to Finwhizz. Apart from handling the accounting, taxes and compliance duties we also share highly informative flash summary reports for the management to make strategic and operational decisions..
Finwhizz ensures that investorsâ€™ money will be smartly channelized to fund those projects which will add more value to business.
