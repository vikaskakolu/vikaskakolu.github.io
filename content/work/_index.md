Are you a finance professional but do not have the time to manage your clients? or,

Are you a finance professional who does not have manpower and resources to manage or take up assignments? or,

Are you an employed finance professional who dream on having your own setup one day but do not have the time to work for it?
Finwhizz is now offering a service to work with finance professionals where they can outsource their entire clientsâ€™ work to us and they will be able to pull back the file whenever they feel they can take it up on their own. We will ensure full confidentiality and will support the professionals as a third party only. This initiative is just acting as a support to fellow upcoming finance professionals to nurture their entrepreneurship spirit.
